**What about our leisure? Criminalization, income and the pandemic. The reality and future of Brazilian funk parties and those who produce them. **


This research aims to show how one of the greatest sources of income and leisure in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the funk parties, was affected by COVID-19. From funk musicians, DJs and sound crews to street vendors, the research aims to draw a socioeconomic, race and gender profile of these people, showing how their income was affected by the coronavirus. It also seeks to reflect on a possible resumption in a post-pandemic scenario, where cultural activities that attract big crowds, such as the funk parties, are likely to have a slower recovery than other sectors.
