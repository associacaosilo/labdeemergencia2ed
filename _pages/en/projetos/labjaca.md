**What about our leisure? Criminalization, income and the pandemic. The reality and future of Brazilian funk parties and those who produce them. **

**PROFILE OF COLLABORATORS:**
  
Professionals connected to studies on the cultures of peripheral communities, preferably black culture; professionals linked to cultural production as well as its financial structure; design professionals whose aesthetics are connected to the peripheries; anthropologists; economists; artists; cultural producers and managers.

**ABSTRACT:**
  
This research aims to show how one of the greatest sources of income and leisure in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the funk parties, was affected by COVID-19. From funk musicians, DJs and sound crews to street vendors, the research aims to draw a socioeconomic, race and gender profile of these people, showing how their income was affected by the coronavirus. It also seeks to reflect on a possible resumption in a post-pandemic scenario, where cultural activities that attract big crowds, such as the funk parties, are likely to have a slower recovery than other sectors.
