**Inclusive – Community Networks for Online Learning Environments**

“Inclusive” is a project whose aims are to develop an autonomous network system for sharing educational materials in text, audio and video formats; and to publish the methodology so it can be replicated by communities with reduced connectivity resources and in situation of social isolation. A booklet was prepared with instructions for implementing the system, and with the concepts emerged during its development. A low cost solution was proposed for a media server whose content is available to the local community through a wi-fi network, accessible with cell phones or computers. The network administration is conducted by the community itself, its structure is based on free software, and it works independently from internet access.
