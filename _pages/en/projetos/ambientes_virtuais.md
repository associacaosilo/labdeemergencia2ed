**RESUMO:**
  
The Community Networks for Online Learning Environments project has as its main goal the development of an autonomous system for the sharing of teaching materials in text, audio and video, particularly those applicable to communities with scarce connectivity resources and in a situation of social isolation. In order to achieve this, the project proposes the design of a low-cost solution to implement a local media server. There, content can be inserted manually by a tutor / teacher and then becomes available to the local community through a wireless network. The network is managed by the community itself, its entire structure is based on free software and it works even without access to the internet, which prevents it from being subject to data plan franchise limits.
