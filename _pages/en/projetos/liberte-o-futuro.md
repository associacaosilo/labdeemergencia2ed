**ABSTRACT:**
  
The aim is to set up a platform to gather the videos that are being collected for the project "Five proposals to postpone the end of the world". The project as a whole stems from the idea that we do not want to "go back to normal", as many have been urging during social isolation, because it was precisely this "normal" that led us to the crises that we are facing. In summary, the general proposal is to: 1) conduct a global survey, due to launch in late June, with five thought-provoking questions to get people around the world to think about the post-pandemic future; 2) gather responses through one-minute videos for each topic and host them on a digital platform (which is what will be carried out in the Emergency Lab); 3) conduct labs to co-create practical actions that can take us towards this world; 4) implement and disseminate the actions planned in the labs.
