**ABSTRACT:**
  
Creation of an online platform with animations based on the stories created by children from the peripheries who received an educational drawing kit - an initiative by the project “Canvases of Hope”.

Developed by the collective Pretinta, which teaches art classes in peripheral communities, this kit seeks to encourage children from the peripheries to build the story of a future where the population is saved and fights COVID-19. This year, the project served more than 200 families from peripheral neighborhoods and riverside communities in Belém, distributing basic food items, hygiene kits, masks and educational drawing kits.
