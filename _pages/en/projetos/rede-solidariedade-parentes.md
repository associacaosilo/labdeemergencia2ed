[Campanha de Vakinha](https://www.vakinha.com.br/vaquinha/acao-solidaria-etnia-terena-no-combate-ao-covid19)

The proposal is a solidarity action network among women from the Terena people who intend to create a way to raise funds for the production and distribution of personal protection and hygiene materials in the villages. The project brings together Terena women in the village Limão Verde (Aquidauana - MS), Aldeinha (Anastácio - MS) and Ipegue (Aquidauana - MS) in this action that culminates in a small cow and will count on the accountability at the end for leadership and consequently for the communities , in addition to the distribution of hygiene products made by the women themselves, prioritizing families with less conditions to obtain such products. The communities together number at least
three thousand people.
