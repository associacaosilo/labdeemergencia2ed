**ABSTRACT:**
  
Alongside the women of the Terena People’s Assembly, the proposal intends to create a way to raise funds for the production and distribution of protection and hygiene materials in the villages. The project brings together Terena women who work as farmers in the Limão Verde village in Aquidauana, MS.They currently don’t have financial resources to continue the production they began in April. Some of the women supported by this initiative are elderly and have been putting themselves at risk by selling their produce in outdoor markets during the pandemic.
