The project applies the concepts of citizen science, one health and nature wellness to the design of curricula aimed at teaching about the relationship between wild animals, domesticated animals and humans, with a focus on environmental conservation and health issues that affect all those who are involved in these relationships. The curricula will be made available through a website with methodological and educational resources of distance learning. They shall contribute, among other things, to increase knowledge on contemporary viruses related to animals (pandemic or not), foster discussions of the Anthropocene and build a “multi-species” life.
