Organizers and communicators with graphic design and audio and video editing skills.

**ABSTRACT:**
  
To narrate is to merge past, present, future and imaginary. To tell stories is to set foot on the ground and at the same time seek the skies. As Guimarães Rosa said, "to narrate is to resist", it is to be alive, exhibiting life, talking about life, demanding life. Ailton Krenak added to the same idea by saying that the end of the world is postponed whenever we are able to tell yet another story. Because we believe in the power of stories in difficult times, we propose the project To Narrate Is to Resist, an online collection of diverse narratives. The storytellers will be residents of the areas surrounding Córrego do Capão and other riverside communities of Venda Nova. The listeners will be their friends, neighbors and others who are not only interested in postponing the end of the world, but willing to get to know other worlds.
