**ABSTRACT:**
  
Development of a prototype for an Android reading training app, with low data usage and offline features. The app will be geared towards children between 7-10 in their literacy development phase. 
It is widely known that educational objects help promote reading and good teaching practices. In such a sensitive time of social isolation, solutions that help teachers in these practices are extremely relevant. Children’s reading habit positively impacts their general development, especially when fostered in a playful, interactive environment.
