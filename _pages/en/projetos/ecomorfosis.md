**Playful and educational activities to teach sustainability and environment concepts in a family setting: an alternative education model for children 	during social isolation caused by COVID-19.**

**PROFILE OF COLLABORATORS:**
  
Audiovisual experts; webpage and YouTube channel developers; social media experts; educators; designers; industrial designers; representatives of recycling cooperatives and cooperatives of catadores.

**ABSTRACT:**
  
The proposal is to create playful, educational activities with plastic recycling, generating new products – such as dolls, parts for games, furniture – through upcycling and product reframing. The project intends to create an understanding and awareness about recycling, prompt the learning of practical skills, and foster bonds among families and with the environment. 
  
The proposal stems from the Ecomorfosis project that began at LABICCR, where we carried out a plastic recycling mini-lab for elementary schools. This year we moved on to a post-LABICCR enhancement of the project, but it had to be replanned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is why we decided to take the mini-lab concept to other places through small activities with simple tools.
