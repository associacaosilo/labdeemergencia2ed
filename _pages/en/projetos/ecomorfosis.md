The proposal is to generate playful and educational activities to learn concepts of sustainability and environment as a model of alternative education for children during social isolation by COVID 19. We are looking to generate new products, through upcycling and re-sign. Ex: Dolls, game chips, containers with bottles, composter, pots, furniture, etc. It aims to raise awareness of recycling, learning practical skills and generating a link with family and the environment.
  
During the laboratory a website was developed where we upload proposals for educational activities that we develop, validated these activities with children and developed a central game where children experience the process of plastic transformation from a board game. 
  
It will also leave the website open for families to download projects to carry them out and also to upload ideas, images and videos of activities, creating a collaborative community with a common goal of improving the environment.
