The proposal is based on Ecomorphosis, a project initiated at the LABICCR organized by SEGIB, where we carry out a mini plastic recycling laboratory for primary schools. This year we started with an instance of maturation, the post labic, where we proposed to develop minilab prototypes in Colombia. Because of the context of the pandemic, we had to rethink the project to be carried out during the pandemic, that is why we decided to bring the concept of the mini lab to homes in the form of small activities with simple tools.
  
The proposal is to generate playful and educational activities to learn concepts of sustainability and environment as a model of alternative education for children during social isolation by COVID 19. We are looking to generate new products, through upcycling and re-sign. Ex: Dolls, game chips, containers with bottles, composter, pots, furniture, etc. It aims to raise awareness of recycling, learning practical skills and generating a link with family and the environment.
  
During the laboratory a website was developed where we upload proposals for educational activities that we develop, validated these activities with children and developed a central game where children experience the process of plastic transformation from a board game. 
  
It will also leave the website open for families to download projects to carry them out and also to upload ideas, images and videos of activities, creating a collaborative community with a common goal of improving the environment.
