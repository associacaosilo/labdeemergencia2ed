**ABSTRACT:**
  
The Dream Incubator is a social innovation lab for the development of collaborative projects. The adaptation to the virtual format will be aimed at public high school students, to be applied in different subjects and classes with the help of teachers. The mission is to trigger collective awareness among the students, leading them to implement concrete initiatives to improve the socioeconomic conditions of their communities and face the difficulties generated in the context of COVID-19.
For the 2nd Emergency Lab, we propose the development of an online pilot that comprises a set of exercises to be shared through low data usage communication apps, such as WhatsApp, which is employed by a large number of young people.
