The objective was to conduct a pilot project of the Online Dream Incubator at the Paulo Freire High School Center, which is a state school located in Brasília, serving students from different neighbourhoods and economic and social conditions. This initiative consisted of supporting students and developing the initial stage of the Online Dream Incubator, motivating them to reflect on the scenario of challenges caused by Covid-19 and creating a “board of dreams for the future” with the vision of generating collaborative projects in communities.
  
During the 2nd edition of the Covid-19 Emergency Laboratory, from 15 to 19 June 2020, the following activities were carried out:
* Establishment of WhatsApp Group of proponents and collaborators
* Organizing meetings with the team
* Analysis of communication apps
* Preparation of registration form
* Establishment of student group
* Creation of WhatsApp “Transmission List” to send content to students
* Creation of WhatsApp “Interaction Group” with students
* Content and online dynamics planning
* Content development (texts, audios, infographics, WhatsApp stickers)
* Sharing missions and content to the interaction group and transmission list
* Group interaction for carrying out and assessing missions
* Elaboration of board of drawings and phrases of dreams 
* Video making 
* Project celebration with students
  
Until June 20, 2020, the following results were achieved:
6 students from the Paulo Freire High School Center experienced and tested this experience;
Successful development and testing of dream identification activities in WhatsApp format in 5 days;
Collaborators from different Brazilian states and from another country contributed to the development of the initiative;
Rapid adaptability of this project in the programme content  in the discipline of Sociology, at the Paulo Freire High School Center, to be implemented in the coming weeks.
The next steps refer to the implementation of the complete pilot project of the Online Dream Incubator at the Paulo Freire High School Center, including the stages of planning, carrying out and celebrating collaborative projects, with effective implementation at school and / or in the communities.
