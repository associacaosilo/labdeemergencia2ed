The goal of this project is to develop open source hardware for a low-cost multi-parameter monitor.

By now, were realized the firsts electronic circuits, an initial programming code and research in medical’s area. The next steps are finish the electronic circuits, the programming codes, an assembly of a prototype and the open source’s publication.
