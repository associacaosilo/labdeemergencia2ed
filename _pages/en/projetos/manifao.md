Interactive online platform aimed to protest in defence of Human Rights, in which everyone can manifest the same day in a single place, in favour of the same cause. This project is inspired by the street demonstrations that occupy streets. However, in Manifão we occupy the cyberspace. During the laboratory we developed the platform and activated a manifestation activity; the chosen theme Manifão for Diversity (“Manifão da Diversidade”), towards the defence of LGBTQIAPN+ rights in the month of Sexual and Gender Diversity and Pride (June). Amongst the functionalities developed and/or activated in the platform are some interactive functions such as collective chat frame, sound and image posting and live video transmission.
  
In the communication actions we articulated contacts with leaders and activists of the LGBTQIPN+ community, press, and the very SILO’s supporting networks, with the purpose of communicating with society about the existence of the project, sending a letter/invitation and other materials about Manifão. We achieved the participation of leaders and activist from different locations in Brazil to join the live transmission in the platform in the day of Manifão.
