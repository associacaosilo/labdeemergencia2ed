**ABSTRACT:**
  
Manifão is an activism and art project: a mobile app aimed at sharing expressions of citizenship and encouraging the free exercise of the right to protest as guaranteed by the Constitution; a space that allows people from different social and geographic origins to demonstrate in a single space, generating collective impact from a device – an internet-connected computer, phone or tablet.
