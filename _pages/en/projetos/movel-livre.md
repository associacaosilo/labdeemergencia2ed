**ABSTRACT:**
  
After observing the impact of the new coronavirus pandemic on domestic spaces and the impossibility of its dwellers to adapt to this reality, a group of architects is proposing the development of a web platform to host a catalog of furniture and objects with a free license. Understanding furniture as a support structure for everyday life, from domestic to common spaces, from rural to urban areas, the project proposes the transformation of the reality of these spaces on a small scale. The platform will compose a catalog of furniture and objects with instruction manuals and technical drawings for their construction. Through the platform, people in rural or urban areas can create the furniture with their own hands or in small local workshops.
